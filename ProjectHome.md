An extension for the open source [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.org/) CMS that allows content contributors to manually baseline version numbers.

This is particularly useful if the latest version of a document is being ingested from elsewhere and the current version number has to be preserved in Alfresco but the full version history does not.

Please don't hesitate to contact the project owner if you'd like to contribute!

For more information, please peruse the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-version-baselining/source/browse/trunk/README.txt'>readme file</a>.
